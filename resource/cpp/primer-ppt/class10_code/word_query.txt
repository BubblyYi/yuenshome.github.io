All things come to those who wait
Victory won''t come to me unless I go to it
We must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite hope
A thousand-li journey is started by taking the first step.
Never, never, never, never give up
A man is not old as long as he is seeking something. 
While there is life there is hope
I am a slow walker,but I never walk backwards.
